*I sat down with Abhinav, Sr. Software Engineer at <a href = "https://wombo.ai" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Wombo</a> to understand how they use SigNoz at Wombo. Abhinav is an experienced software engineer with 7+ yrs of experience working at companies like LinkedIn and Google. Hereâ€™s a few snippets from our conversation (edited for legibility)*


![Wombo Case Study](/img/case_study/wombo-banner.webp)

### *Can you share about what does Wombo do? What are your key products?*

Wombo at its core creates AI-generated content for the mass public.

We make AI-generated content which are easy to use rather than being very technical so that every day user can just play with it and have fun with it, and also create content for their needs.

We have 2 key products:
- Wombo Song - It is a generative video platform where we take the user image and generate a song out of memory like you can put your face, you can upload your face and it. You can choose a song and it generates like you are singing that song.

- Dream - AI generated art product similar to Stable Diffusion but much more simpler to use.


### *How is engineering team at Wombo organised?*

Ours is a very small team. We have five back-end engineers and they're the same as in for our data engineers.

We handle from the coding to reviewing, to deployment, to debugging, to the health of the system, everything.


### *What were the business problems you were trying to solve when you started exploring SigNoz?*

As a product, we want to get state of the art features around AI content generation to our users fast and always keep building new features so that users are engaged with the platform. They should like to spend time on the platform and find it useful. So, the user experience of the product is very important for us.


To give you an idea of scale, we have over 5 million monthly active users. We were number one app in the US a few times and we already have over a billion like artefacts generated by users. We needed a system which allows us to get an understanding of whats happening in our tech infrastructure so that we can get a better understanding of user experience. How fast are users seeing the product and if some issues happen - how can we quickly find out what's happening and debug it.

Being a small team, we don't have time to do too much testing. We test in production and believe that our observability system should be good enough, that we can quickly address any issues which happen. This helps us be fast and ship features to users faster.

So what we wanted was firs, since we are developing new features all the time, both from the application perspective and in the AI model perspective, we wanted to deploy as soon as possible and in general see whether we are breaking anything.

Hence monitoring was super important for us. I think the most crtitical thing for me was safe deployments and health of the system because we want to know immediately if something has gone wrong or not. So that we can take the corrective actions as soon as possible.

### *What are the key use cases you had for SigNoz?*

The key metrics was the image generation time. But other than that, I think the ability to find the logs across multiple containers is also very important.


Although we are not fully service oriented, but still we have things like celery queues. We have machine learning AI models which run om NVIDIA cards on AWS. They are separate container from the actual API that the front end, like mobile or webpapp talks to to get the request response. So, getting a complete view there was important.

At the end of the day, from an end user's perspective, we would like to see the life cycle of a person.

How that person interacted? So simply like searching, let's say the user ID in some search bar and seeing, okay, this user went through these logs in the back end and he went through these logs. This is what happened to him in the AI and this is where the problem happened, stuff like that.

Logs were pretty important along with exceptions. For example, immediately when we deplo a new release if we see, oh, this is a new exception that we never saw or we didn't expect. Why is this happening, the ability to step through traces, what was the SQL statement that was called there.

Oh, this is stepping through all those calls. Or, okay, I'm hitting graph DB. Why is it taking time or is it the SQL taking time? Is it the cache taking time?

We have multiple data sources. Ability to see which data source is taking time and why, is very important for us.

### *How did SigNoz compared to other solutions you evaluated?*


<LiteYoutubeEmbed id="cuRyrvZpYV4" mute={false} />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

We tried few other tools like DataDog.

The setup time for SigNoz was pretty low. I got the basic traces and exceptions setup working within one and a half days, and I could see these data for our development environment.

For the other tools, it took about two weeks. While with SigNoz, I was able to at least get to that stage in a single day, without any help. Just by reading the docs and following the steps.

Even the AWS setup was pretty easy. I never had to use or go to my website to actually do anything. Mostly just following the instructions and copy pasting pretty much worked.

Whereas for DataDog you have to go to either AWS CLI or AWS console and manually change some very specific things. This was pretty cumbersome in our experience.

The fact that I got SigNoz running in a single day, at least the traces and exceptions part, was pretty huge.

### *Why team at Wombo prefers open source software?*
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<LiteYoutubeEmbed id="AO3tpixbf8M" mute={false} />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

It's very simple to find solutions to problems without needing to depend on contacting someone in a company. There's just a bigger community, so in general we will find answers and whatever issues we create more people are looking at it.

There will be community contributors and dedicated contributors which makes getting help from the community much easier.We also like contributing back to the open source community and engaging with them, and hence it's a win-win.


### *Any advice for new teams setting up their observability systems?*

The topmost criteria I would say is, does the tool have all the important features? Logs, traces and metrics , does it have all those things?

The second thing is how easy is it to set up and maintain? Even if setup takes a bit of time, it should be easy to maintain.

So every time you change something in your infrastructure, do you have to change something in your observability platform also? And even if you have to, how easy or how hard is it to make the required changes.

I think these are the top two things : completeness of feature set and less maintenance.
